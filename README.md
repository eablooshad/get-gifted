# Recommendation App

## Project Overview
This app allows users to receive gift recommendations by age, keyword, and category. The primary goal is to refine the functionality of the recommendation system, focusing on reliable data handling, flexible query options, and efficient data retrieval.

## Features and Functional Goals
1. **User Input Interface**
   - Accepts multiple search criteria, including:
      - Age range selection
      - Keyword (as a checkbox for available options)
      - Category (as a checkbox for available options)

2. **Recommendations Engine**
   - Uses criteria to filter data and deliver a customized list of relevant gift options.

## Database and Data Management
- **Data Source**: Currently based on a CSV file, loaded at runtime for initial prototyping. Will explore migration options to a more robust database.
- **Database Policies**:
   - **Read**: Efficiently retrieves large volumes of data for filtering.
   - **Write**: Future updates will allow admin access for adding/removing items.
   - **Multiple Data Sources**: The app should support reading from various sources as needed (e.g., another CSV or integrated databases).

## Roadmap
1. **Database Integration**:
   - Transition to a persistent database solution, ensuring read/write capability.
   - Enable support for multiple data sources with standardized policies.

2. **Functionality Expansion**:
   - Improve input form validation.
   - Enable caching to speed up results for repeated queries.

3. **User Interface (Future)**:
   - Low priority for now; basic styling applied for usability.
   - Design improvements will follow once functionality is stable.
